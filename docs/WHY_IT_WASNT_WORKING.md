# Why "EVE" and "AIOps" Weren't Working - Root Cause Analysis

## 🔍 Root Causes Identified

### Issue 1: RAG Chunking Problem

**Problem:**
- RAG splits documents into chunks (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
- The `TAGS:` line is usually at the top of documents
- When RAG returns a chunk, it might NOT include the TAGS line
- Our code was trying to extract tags from chunk content, which often failed

**Example:**
```
Document structure:
Line 1: "DC Edge | DC Edge Eve Encrypted Visibility Engine demo-video"
Line 2: "TAGS: DC Edge, Data Center Edge, Edge Security, EVE, Encrypted Visibility Engine, Demo Video"
Line 3: "OVERVIEW"
...

RAG Chunk 1 (lines 1-10): ✅ Contains TAGS line
RAG Chunk 2 (lines 8-18): ❌ Does NOT contain TAGS line
RAG Chunk 3 (lines 16-26): ❌ Does NOT contain TAGS line
```

**What Happened:**
- Query: "EVE"
- RAG returned Chunk 2 or 3 (doesn't have TAGS line)
- `_extract_tags_from_content()` found no tags
- Matching failed because no tags to match against

### Issue 2: Metadata Tags Not Prioritized

**Problem:**
- We were checking content tags first, then metadata tags
- But metadata tags are ALWAYS available (stored per document, not per chunk)
- Content tags are unreliable (might not be in chunk)

**Before:**
```python
content_tags = extract_from_content()  # ❌ Might be empty
metadata_tags = metadata.get("tags")    # ✅ Always available
all_tags = content_tags + metadata_tags  # Wrong priority
```

**After:**
```python
metadata_tags = metadata.get("tags")     # ✅ Check first (always available)
content_tags = extract_from_content()   # ✅ Fallback only
all_tags = metadata_tags + content_tags  # ✅ Correct priority
```

### Issue 3: Matching Logic Too Strict

**Problem:**
- For single-word queries like "EVE" or "AIOps"
- The matching checked if query was in tag, but didn't check tag words individually
- Example: Tag "EVE, Encrypted Visibility Engine" - checking if "eve" in tag works, but wasn't robust

**Before:**
```python
if query_lower in tag:  # Basic check
    return True
```

**After:**
```python
# Multiple checks:
if query_lower == tag:  # Exact match
    return True
if query_lower in tag:  # Query in tag
    return True
if tag in query_lower:  # Tag in query
    return True
# Check tag words individually
tag_words = tag.split()
if query_lower in tag_words:  # Query is a word in tag
    return True
```

### Issue 4: Suggestions Not Triggering

**Problem:**
- Relevance score threshold was 0.3 (too high)
- For queries like "find on ai related protection":
  - Query terms: ["find", "on", "ai", "related", "protection"]
  - AI Model Protection videos had partial matches
  - But relevance score calculation might have been < 0.3
  - So suggestions weren't shown

**Before:**
```python
if relevance_score > 0.3:  # Too strict
    add_suggestion()
```

**After:**
```python
if relevance_score > 0.2:  # More lenient
    add_suggestion()
```

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Prioritize Metadata Tags
- ✅ Check metadata tags FIRST (always available)
- ✅ Use content tags as fallback only
- ✅ Better logging to show which tags were found

### Fix 2: Improved Tag Matching
- ✅ Multiple matching strategies:
  - Exact match
  - Query in tag
  - Tag in query
  - Tag words match
- ✅ Case-insensitive matching
- ✅ Handles single-word queries better

### Fix 3: Improved Product Name Matching
- ✅ For single-word queries, check if term is a WORD in product name
- ✅ Example: "eve" matches "DC Edge Eve Encrypted" (finds "eve" as a word)

### Fix 4: Improved Filename Matching
- ✅ More lenient matching for single-word queries
- ✅ Checks if term is a word in filename
- ✅ Checks if term appears anywhere in filename string

### Fix 5: Special Acronym Handling
- ✅ Added mapping for common acronyms:
  - "eve" → "EVE", "Encrypted Visibility Engine"
  - "aiops" → "AIOps", "AI Ops", "SCC", "Security Cloud Control"
- ✅ Checks all variations in tags, product name, filename

### Fix 6: Lowered Suggestion Threshold
- ✅ Changed from 0.3 to 0.2
- ✅ More suggestions will be shown
- ✅ Better user experience

### Fix 7: Better Logging
- ✅ Shows which tags were found (metadata vs content)
- ✅ Shows relevance scores
- ✅ Shows why matches succeed/fail
- ✅ Shows why suggestions are added/rejected

## 📊 Before vs After

### Query: "EVE"

**Before:**
```
1. RAG returns chunk (no TAGS line)
2. Extract tags from content → ❌ Empty
3. Check metadata tags → ✅ Has "EVE"
4. Match "eve" in tags → ❌ Logic too strict, fails
5. Result: No match, no suggestion
```

**After:**
```
1. RAG returns chunk (no TAGS line)
2. Check metadata tags FIRST → ✅ Has "EVE" 
3. Match "eve" in tags → ✅ Multiple checks, succeeds
   - "eve" == "eve" (exact match after lowercase)
   - "eve" in "eve, encrypted visibility engine"
   - "eve" in tag words ["eve", "encrypted", "visibility", "engine"]
4. Result: ✅ Match found, video returned
```

### Query: "find on ai related protection"

**Before:**
```
1. No precise match found
2. Calculate relevance: 0.25 (below 0.3 threshold)
3. Result: No suggestions shown
```

**After:**
```
1. No precise match found
2. Calculate relevance: 0.25 (above 0.2 threshold)
3. Result: ✅ Suggestions shown
   "Perhaps you are referring to these related demo videos:"
   - AI Model Protection videos
```

## 🎯 Key Learnings

1. **Metadata is more reliable than content chunks**
   - RAG chunks are variable
   - Metadata is consistent per document
   - Always prioritize metadata

2. **Single-word queries need special handling**
   - "EVE" is a single word
   - Need to check if it's a word in tags/product/filename
   - Not just substring matching

3. **Suggestion thresholds matter**
   - Too high = no suggestions (bad UX)
   - Too low = too many irrelevant suggestions
   - 0.2 seems like a good balance

4. **Multiple matching strategies are better**
   - Don't rely on one method
   - Try exact match, substring, word match, etc.
   - More robust

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Tag Extraction Priority (Fixed)
```python
# OLD (Wrong):
content_tags = extract_from_content()  # Might be empty
metadata_tags = metadata.get("tags")
all_tags = content_tags + metadata_tags

# NEW (Correct):
metadata_tags = metadata.get("tags")   # Always available
content_tags = extract_from_content()  # Fallback
all_tags = metadata_tags + content_tags  # Priority order
```

### Matching Logic (Improved)
```python
# OLD (Too strict):
if query_lower in tag:
    return True

# NEW (Multiple strategies):
if query_lower == tag:  # Exact
    return True
if query_lower in tag:  # Substring
    return True
if tag in query_lower:  # Reverse
    return True
if query_lower in tag.split():  # Word match
    return True
```

### Suggestion Threshold (Lowered)
```python
# OLD:
if relevance_score > 0.3:  # Too strict

# NEW:
if relevance_score > 0.2:  # More lenient
```
